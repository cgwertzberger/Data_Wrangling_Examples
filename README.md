# Data_Wrangling_Examples
#### A couple of examples of R code that I worked on as assignments at the University of Iowa.  
The Wertzberger files are examples of homework submissions where we worked with various data sets. The 9_09_21 file does basic R calcualtions to see how people in 2020 and 2021 were spending valentines, etc. The 10_17 file focuses on cleaning a data set so it is ready for processing.   
The crypto file is a file for a project determining how the stock market relates to the crypto market. This file creates empty lists and then uses data over time to find correlations.
